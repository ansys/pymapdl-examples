Introduction\n\nSeveral hyperelastic constitutive models can be used to model the large deformation\nbehavior of elastic materials; however, it is sometimes difficult to select parameters\nto adequately match the behavior of the material.\nThe curve-fitting process fits the hyperelastic constitutive model parameters to a set\nof experimental data using a least-squares minimization.\n\nCurve-fitting is relatively simple, but certain conditions can affect the accuracy of\nthe resulting constitutive model.\nThe constitutive model should therefore be compared with experimental data to ensure\nthat it adequately reproduces the material behavior over the actual range of deformation."},{"objectID":"Home","href":"technology_showcase_examples/techdemo-15/ex_15-teccalvalhyper.html#152-problem-description","title":"Calibrating and validating a hyperelastic constitutive model > 15.2.

Introduction","text":"28.1. Introduction\n\nFriction Stir Welding (FSW) is a solid-state welding technique that involves\nthe joining of metals without filler materials. A cylindrical rotating tool\nplunges into a rigidly clamped workpiece and moves along the joint to be\nwelded. As the tool translates along the joint, heat is generated by friction\nbetween the tool shoulder and the workpiece. Additional heat is generated by\nplastic deformation of the workpiece material.\nThe generated heat results in thermal softening of the workpiece material.\nThe translation of the tool causes the softened workpiece material to flow\nfrom the front to the back of the tool where it consolidates.\nAs cooling occurs, a solid continuous joint between the two plates is formed.\nNo melting occurs during the process, and the resulting\ntemperature remains below the solidus temperature of the metals being joined.\nFSW offers many advantages over conventional welding techniques, and has been\nsuccessfully applied in the aerospace, automobile, and shipbuilding industries.\n\nThermal and mechanical behaviors are mutually dependent during the FSW process.\nBecause the temperature field affects stress distribution, this example uses a\nfully thermomechanically coupled model.\nThe model consists of a coupled-field solid element with structural and thermal\ndegrees of freedom. The model has two rectangular steel plates and a cylindrical\ntool. All necessary mechanical and thermal\n28.5. Boundary conditions and loading are applied on the model. The\nsimulation occurs over three load steps, representing the 28.5.3. Loading of\nthe process.\n\nThe temperature rises at the contact interface due to frictional contact\nbetween the tool and workpiece. FSW generally occurs when the temperature at\nthe weld line region reaches 70 to 90 percent of the melting temperature of the\nworkpiece material. The temperature obtained around the weld line region in\nthis example falls within the range reported by Zhu and Chao [Zhu2004] and\nPrasanna and Rao [Prasanna2010], while the maximum resulting temperature is\nwell below the melting temperature of the workpiece.\n\nThe calculated frictional heat generation and plastic heat generation show that\nthe friction between the tool shoulder and workpiece is responsible for\ngenerating most of the heat. A bonding temperature is specified at the contact\ninterface of the plates to model the welding behind the tool. When the\ntemperature at the contact surface exceeds this bonding temperature, the\ncontact is changed to bonded."},{"objectID":"Home","href":"technology_showcase_examples/techdemo-28/ex_28-tecfricstir.html#282-problem-description","title":"Friction Stir Welding (FSW) simulation > 28.2.

Problem description\n\nThe Zhu and Chao thermomechanical model\n\nThe model used in this example is a simplified version of the thermomechanical\nmodel developed by Zhu and Chao for FSW with 304L stainless steel [Zhu2004].\nZhu and Chao presented nonlinear thermal and thermomechanical simulations using\nthe finite element analysis code WELDSIM. They initially formulated a\nheat-transfer problem using a moving heat source, and later used the transient\ntemperature outputs from the thermal analysis to determine residual stresses in\nthe welded plates via a 3-D elastoplastic thermomechanical simulation.\n\nA direct coupled-field analysis is performed on a reduced-scale version of the\nZhu and Chao model [Zhu2004]. Also, rather than using a moving heat source as\nin the reference model, a rotating and moving tool is used for a more realistic\nsimulation.\n\nThe tool pin is ignored.

In the past, FSW was used for soft workpiece\nmaterials such as aluminium. With the development of tools made from\nsuper-abrasive materials such as polycrystalline cubic boron nitride (PCBN),\nFSW has become possible with high-temperature materials such as stainless\nsteel. A cylindrical PCBN tool is modeled in this case.\n\nThe workpiece sides parallel to the weld line are constrained in all the\ndirections to simulate the clamping ends. The bottom side of the workpiece is\nconstrained in the perpendicular (z) direction to simulate support at the\nbottom. Heat losses are considered on all the surfaces of the model. All\n28.5.

A temperature-dependent\ncoefficient of friction (0.4 to 0.2) helps to prevent the maximum temperature\nfrom exceeding the material melting point.\n\nThe observed temperature rise in the model shows that heat generation during\nthe second and third load steps is due to friction between the tool shoulder\nand workpiece, as well as plastic deformation of the workpiece material.\n\nThe melting temperature of 304L stainless steel is 1450 °C. As shown in the\nfollowing figure, the maximum temperature range at the weld line region on the\nworkpiece beneath the tool is well below the melting temperature of the\nworkpiece material during the second and third load steps, but above 70 percent\nof the melting temperature:\n\n\n\nFigure 28.16: Maximum temperature (on workpiece beneath the tool) variation with time\n\nThe two plates can be welded together within this temperature range.\n\nThe following figure shows the temperature distributions on the top surface of\nthe workpiece along the transverse distance (perpendicular to the weld line):\n\n\n\nFigure 28.17: Temperature distribution on the top surface of workpiece at various locations\n\nAs shown in the following figure and table, the temperature plots indicate the\ntemperature distribution at various locations on the weld line when the maximum\ntemperature occurs at those locations:\n\nTable 28.5: Locations on weld line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation number\n\nDistance on the weld line in y direction\n\nTime when maximum temperature occurs\n\n1\n\n0.016 m\n\n15.25 Sec\n\n2\n\n0.027 m\n\n19.2 Sec\n\n3\n\n0.040 m\n\n24 Sec\n\nThe following figure shows the temperature distribution in the thickness direction\nat location 1:\n\n\n\nFigure 28.19: Temperature distribution in thickness direction at location 1\n\nAs expected, the highest temperature caused by heat generation appears around\nthe weld line region. By comparing the above temperature results with the\nreference results, it can be determined that the temperatures obtained at the\nweld line are well below the melting temperature of the workpiece material, but\nstill sufficient for friction stir welding.\n\nThe following table and figure show the time-history response of the\ntemperature at various locations on the weld line:\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation number\n\nDistance on the weld line\n\n1\n\n0.018 m\n\n2\n\n0.023 m\n\n3\n\n0.027 m\n\n4\n\n0.032 m\n\n5\n\n0.035 m\n\n6\n\n0.039 m\n\n\n\nFigure 28.20: Temperature variation with time on various joint locations"},{"objectID":"Home","href":"technology_showcase_examples/techdemo-28/ex_28-tecfricstir.html#2873-welding-results","title":"Friction Stir Welding (FSW) simulation > 28.7.3.

Recommendations","text":"28.9. Recommendations\n\nTo perform a similar FSW analysis, consider the following hints and\nrecommendations:\n\nFSW is a coupled-field (structural-thermal) process. The temperature field\naffects the stress distribution during the entire process. Also, heat generated\nin structural deformation affects the temperature field. The direct method of\ncoupling is recommended for such processes. This method involves just one\nanalysis that uses a coupled-field element containing all necessary degrees of\nfreedom. Direct coupling is advantageous when the coupled-field interaction\ninvolves strongly coupled physics or is highly nonlinear.\n\nA nonlinear transient analysis is preferable for simulations where the\nobjective is to study the transient temperature and transient heat\ntransfer.\n\nThe dynamic effects of different physics should be controlled. In this\nproblem, for example, the dynamic effects of the structural degrees of freedom\nare disabled as they are unimportant.\n\nSeparating the solution process into three load steps helps you to understand\nthe physics and solve the problem.\n\nThe contact between the two plates must be nearly perfect to maintain\ntemperature continuity. For a perfect thermal contact, specify a high thermal\ncontact conductance (TCC) coefficient between workpiece plates. A high\ncoefficient results in temperature continuity across the interface.\n\nBecause the problem is nonlinear, proper solution settings are required. Set\nthe following analysis controls to the appropriate values to achieve the\nconverged solution: Mapdl.lnsrch(),\nMapdl.cutcontrol(),\nMapdl.kbc(),\nMapdl.neqit(),\nMapdl.nropt(),\nand Mapdl.autots().\n\nConvergence at the second and third load steps is difficult to achieve. The\ndepth of penetration of the tool on the workpiece (UZ), rotational speed of the\ntool (ROTZ), and time-step size play crucial roles in the convergence of the\nsecond load step. Use a very small time-step size if the rotational speed is\nhigher than 60 RPM.\n\nA symmetric mesh (about the joint line) is preferred to capture the exact\noutputs and their effects on the workpiece. A hex mesh with dropped midside\nnodes is recommended for the workpiece as well as the tool.\nThis approach helps to maintain symmetry and prevent the temperature\nfrom reaching negative values during the simulation.\n\nA minimum of two element layers is required in the thickness direction. A fine\nsweep mesh near the weld line yields more accurate results; however, too fine a\nmesh increases computational time. A fine mesh is unnecessary on the tool side.\nTo minimize computational time, the tool can be considered to be rigid with no\ntemperature degrees of freedom."},{"objectID":"Home","href":"technology_showcase_examples/techdemo-28/ex_28-tecfricstir.html#2810-references","title":"Friction Stir Welding (FSW) simulation > 28.10.

Introduction","text":"1.1. Introduction\n\nEliminating brake noise is a classic challenge in the automotive industry. Brake discs\ndevelop large and sustained friction-induced oscillations, simple referred to as brake\nsqueal.\n\nTwo common theories describe brake-squeal phenomena:\n\nStick-slip theory – The self-excited\nvibration of a brake system occurs when the static coefficient of friction is\ngreater than the sliding coefficient of friction. Variable friction forces\nintroduce energy into the system which is not properly dissipated during the\nsquealing event, resulting in large vibrations.\n\nMode-coupling theory – When two similar\ncharacteristic modes couple with each other, instability is introduced to the\nbraking system. This instability is caused primarily by improperly selected\ngeometric parameters.\nBoth theories attribute brake squeal to variable friction forces at the disc-pad\ninterface.\n\nBrake noise is generally categorized as follows:\n\nLow-frequency noise – An example of a low-frequency noise is the\n“groaning” noise which occurs in the frequency range between 100 and\n1000 Hz. Any noise having a frequency above 1000 Hz is considered a\nsqueal.\n\nLow-frequency squeal – A result of mode coupling occurring between the\nout-of-plane modes of the rotor and the bending modes of the brake pad.\n\nHigh-frequency squeal – A result of mode coupling occurring between the\nin-plane modes of the rotor.\nLow- and high-frequency squealing can be determined via complex eigensolvers. The\npresence of unstable modes suggests that the geometry parameters and material properties\nof the braking system should be modified.\n\nFor more information, see brake-squeal (prestressed modal) analysis  in the structural analysis guide."},{"objectID":"Home","href":"technology_showcase_examples/techdemo-1/ex_01-tecbrakesqueal.html#12-problem-description","title":"Brake squeal analysis > 1.2.

It is a tedious process requiring a matched mesh\nat the disc-pad interface along with assumptions related to the amount of area in\ncontact and sliding.\n\n3-D contact elements (CONTA17x) offer a more efficient alternative by modeling\nsurface-to-surface contact at the pad-disc interface. With contact\nsurface-to-surface contact elements, a matched mesh is unnecessary at the\ncontact-target surface, and there is no need to calculate the unsymmetric\nterms.\n\nContact surface-to-surface elements offer many controls for defining contact\npairs, such as the type of contact surface, algorithm, contact stiffness, and\ngap/initial penetration effect."},{"objectID":"Home","href":"technology_showcase_examples/techdemo-1/ex_01-tecbrakesqueal.html#132-modeling-contact-pairs","title":"Brake squeal analysis > 1.3.2.

Modeling contact pairs\n\nFrictional surface-to-surface contact pairs with a 0.3 coefficient of friction are\nused to define contact between the brake pads and disc to simulate frictional\nsliding contact occurring at the pad-disc interface. Bonded surface-to-surface\ncontact pairs are used to define the contact for other components which will be\nalways in contact throughout the braking operation.\n\nThe augmented Lagrange algorithm is used for the frictional contact pairs, as the\npressure and frictional stresses are augmented during equilibrium iterations in such\na way that the penetration is reduced gradually. The augmented Lagrange algorithm\nalso requires fewer computational resources than the standard Lagrange multiplier\nalgorithm, which normally requires additional iterations to ensure that the contact\ncompatibility is satisfied exactly. The augmented Lagrange is well suited for\nmodeling general frictional contact, such as the contact between the brake pad and\ndisc defined in this example.\n\nAn internal multipoint constraint (MPC) contact algorithm is used for bonded\ncontact because it ties contact and target surface together efficiently for\nsolid-solid assembly. The MPC algorithm builds equations internally based on the\ncontact kinematics and does not require the degrees of freedom of the contact\nsurface nodes, reducing the wave front size of the equation solver.
