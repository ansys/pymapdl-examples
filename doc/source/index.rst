PyMAPDL documentation |version|
===============================

The technology showcase examples for `PyMAPDL <pymapdl_docs_>`_
are contained into this repository.

These are more complex examples that the ones presented in the 
`APDL Verification Manual <mapdl_vm_>`_. 
They are complete examples which necesitate more resources.
Their purpose is to demonstrate the PyMAPDL's capabilities with concrete examples.

Here are a series of examples using MAPDL with ``ansys-mapdl-core``. 
They initially come from the `APDL Technology Showcase Manual <mapdl_tech_show_>`_. They have been reproduced
in Python files thanks to PyMAPDL.
