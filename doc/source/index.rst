.. === TECHNOLOGY SHOWCASES ===

Technology Showcases
====================


This documentation demonstrates the broad simulation capabilities of Ansys Mechanical
APDL.
The problems demonstrate how to use PyMAPDL to effectively and accurately
solve interdisciplinary problems from a variety of industries and engineering
fields.

Summary of the exposed Technology Showcases
-------------------------------------------

The exposed files are more complex examples than the ones presented in the `APDL
Verification Manual <mapdl_vm_>`_. They are complete and concrete case studies
which necessitate more resources.
