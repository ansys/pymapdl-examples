Technology Showcase Manual Examples
====================================

The  following examples initially come from the `APDL Technology Showcase Manual
<mapdl_tech_show_>`_. They initially were MAPDL files. They have been reproduced
in Python files using PyMAPDL with the ``ansys-mapdl-core`` library.

These examples are a work-in-progress and will be extended during the life of
this project.
